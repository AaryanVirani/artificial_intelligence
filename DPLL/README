Ensure that the `DPLL.py` file is in the same directory as the `puzzleSolver.py` file. 

The input file is a text file containing the following information:
- First line indicating number of vertices, empty spaces, and maximum number of moves
- Showing the initial state of the puzzle
- Showing the final state of the puzzle
- Subsequent lines showing the edges of the puzzle, with each line representing an edge

Ensure that the input file is in the same directory as the `puzzleSolver.py` file. Name it as `input.txt`.

To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:
```
python puzzleSolver.py
```

The output will be printed onto two text files:
- `frontend.txt` which prints out the corresponding clauses for the puzzle
- `backend.txt` which prints out the solution to the puzzle, if it exists
