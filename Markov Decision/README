- First line indicating containing six parameters: non-terminal states, terminal states, actions, rounds, frequency of output, and hyperparameter M
- Second line lists the terminal-state rewards as pairs
- Third line lists the costs of each action
- Subsequent lines provide transition probabilities for the markov decision process.

Ensure that the input file is in the same directory as the `markov_decision.py` file. Name it as `input.txt`.

To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:
```
python markov_decision.py
```

The output will be printed onto:
